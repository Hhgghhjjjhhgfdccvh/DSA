Here are the key takeaways you should store and revisit regularly for your benefit:

Preparation Strategy for Google & Amazon Interviews
1. DSA & Algorithm Practice
Grind169 & AlgoMonster:

Reviewed all Grind169 solutions using AlgoMonster for consistency.
Used a standard BFS template across problems.
Focused on medium-level LeetCode problems, skipped most easy & hard ones.
Practiced DFS, BFS, and Graph/Tree algorithms.
Used ChatGPT to debug and optimize solutions.
Time Allocation:

2â€“3 hours on weekdays, 4â€“6 hours on weekends for initial prep.
3â€“4 hours on weekdays, 6â€“8 hours on weekends for onsite prep.
Resources Used:

TUF YouTube Channel
Two Pointers (12 videos)
Dynamic Programming (40/57 videos)
Graphs (20/56 videos)
NeetCode for concise explanations
AlgoMonster Templates for problem types
LeetCode Hard problems: Attempted solutions, then implemented from scratch.
2. Onsite Interview Strategy
Goal: Solve problems within 10-20 minutes under pressure.

Implementation Efficiency:

Used TUF & AlgoMonster templates for structured problem-solving.
Practiced spaced repetitionâ€”re-implemented problems instead of just reviewing.
Focused on patterns in problems to recognize solutions faster.
Dry Run Technique:

Write test cases as comments before coding.
Step through the code manually & note variable changes.
Focus on edge cases (empty lists, no nodes in graphs/trees, negative inputs).
3. LLD Preparation (Amazon)
Common Design Patterns Used:
Strategy & Factory Design Patterns
Observer & Singleton Design Patterns
Common LLD Questions:
Design LRU/LFU Cache
Package Delivery System, Parking Lot, Hotel Booking System, Chess Game
Key Approach:
Identify essential classes first.
Use hashmaps for fast lookups, doubly linked lists for O(1) removals.
Break down problems into modular components.
4. Behavioral Interview (Amazon)
Used the STAR method for structured responses.
Prepared 5-6 strong examples covering Amazon's Leadership Principles.
Handled negative situations (e.g., missing a deadline, resolving conflicts).
Tech Interview Handbook Resource: Behavioral Interview Guide
General Insights
Google focuses on problem-solving, Amazon on system design (LLD).
Don't memorize solutionsâ€”understand patterns & templates.
Interview success involves luck; rejection isnâ€™t always a reflection of skill.
Applied to 1,700 jobs in 7 months, only got 5 interviewsâ€”resume filtering is tough.
Referrals help, but arenâ€™t a guarantee (4 Amazon referrals = 3 auto-rejects, 1 success).
No LeetCode contests participated.
No internship at FAANG but still cracked Amazon.

Daily/Weekly Study Plan
Daily: Solve 2-3 medium LeetCode problems + 30 mins of LLD prep.
Weekly:
Revise previously solved problems.
Watch TUF videos at 2x speed for new concepts.
Dry run past solutions to reinforce retention.
Mock interview once a week to practice thinking aloud.
