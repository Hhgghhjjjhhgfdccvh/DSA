The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm designed to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.

 üîπ Algorithm Steps
Initialization:

Create a dist[] array initialized to INF for all nodes except the source, which is set to 0.
Relaxation Process (Main Step):

Repeat this for V-1 times (where V is the number of vertices):
‚û°Ô∏è For each edge (u, v, w), if dist[u] + w < dist[v], update dist[v] = dist[u] + w.
Negative Cycle Check:

Perform one additional iteration over all edges.
If any distance is still reduced, a negative weight cycle exists.
